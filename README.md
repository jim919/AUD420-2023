# AUD420-2023

Using the Supercollider app we are tasked to create a music track. In order for the music to properly function and we don't encounter any unwarranted errors, we follow the following steps:  

1. boot server
2. testing for activation 
3. placing synthwaves 
4. reading the buffers
5. starting recording using server.default.record
6. play the song (play each part in the order you choose)
7. stop recording
