# AUD420-2023

Using the Supercollider app we are tasked to create a music track. In order for the music to properly function and we don't encounter any unwarranted errors, we follow the following steps:  

1. boot server
2. testing for activation 
3. placing synthwaves 
4. reading the buffers
5. starting recording using server.default.record
6. play the song (play each part in the order you choose)
7. stop recording 

# Files in this repository 
## University.scd 
The file above will be the main source of code used to create our music track. 

## Sound files/audio: 
### cruel1 (1).wav 
2 seconds.
A slight stroke of a violin. Calm and used into the overall symphony. 

### cruel1 (2).wav 
1 second. 
An electronic sound. Repetetive. Will be used softly in the background, so it doesn't overshadow the rest of the sounds.

### cruel1 (3).wav 
2 seonds. 
Similar to the first one. 

### cruel1 (4).wav 
10 seconds.
The longest preexisting sound so far. Has a long pause in the middle but still remains the primary focus of our music track. 

### cruel1 (5).wav 
3 seconds. 
Short yet comprehensive. 

*Certain parameters of each sound we import into Supercollider will be modified to create our music track.
